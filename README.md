Jarvis is an advanced AI-powered Discord bot built to interact with a large language model (LLM) to provide intelligent, human-like responses. Inspired by Iron Man's AI assistant, Jarvis, this bot allows users to ask questions or give prompts, and receive thoughtful, AI-generated responses.

The bot communicates with an LLM model hosted on a server, capable of generating text based on a variety of prompts. Whether you're looking for casual conversations or more complex problem-solving assistance, Jarvis is designed to provide useful and engaging interactions.
